abstract: "Previous research has established that basic facial expressions vary considerably in terms of the speed with which they are perceived, including those which are often said to have similar levels of dimensional factors such as valence and arousal. This study aimed (1) to replicate these previous findings; (2) to compare statistical models of response time data based on the discrete factor of basic emotions and the dimensional factors of valence and arousal; and (3) to investigate the potential effects of ethnicity and current emotional state. Participants completed an online task in which they were presented with emotional phrases, followed by facial expression images, and were instructed to report whether each combination matched as quickly as possible. The emotional phrases used were independently piloted to ensure suitability for inclusion. While variance in response times among basic facial expressions was found, this was notably more minimal than in some previous research, something which is attributed to methodological differences. Statistical models based on discrete emotions and valence/arousal were found to fit the data equally well, indicating that variance in response times among expressions did not need to be explained beyond valence and arousal alone. Neither ethnicity nor current emotional state were found to affect response times. These findings suggest that temporal facial expression perception research might best focus on dimensional factors such as valence and arousal moving forward."
