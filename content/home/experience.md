    description: I am leading an independent research project under the supervision of [Dr Ashley Brown](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/ashley-brown) at the Department of Psychology, King's College London, the aim of which is to develop and validate a new quantitative scale of gender salience. This will involve the completion of a pre-registered quantitative study, during which data will be analysed using a combination of structural equation modelling and regression modelling techniques. Read more about the project [here](https://jacob-knyspel.netlify.app/project/gender-salience-scale-project/). My responsibilities include: (i) designing the research, (ii) applying for ethical approval, (iii) applying for funding, (iv) pre-registering the research, (v) managing participant recruitment, (vi) analysing psychometric data, and (vii) writing a manuscript of the finished research.

    description: I completed a self-led research project under the supervision of [Dr. Charlotte Russell](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/charlotte-russell) (King’s College London), which formed the basis of my final-year undergraduate dissertation. I used generalized linear mixed-effect modelling and likelihood-based model comparisons to provide new insight into the temporal mechanics of facial expression perception in healthy individuals. For this project I was awarded an *Undergraduate Poster Conference Prize* and nominated for the *EPS/BSA Undergraduate Project Prize* and *BPS Cognitive Section Undergraduate Project Prize*.
