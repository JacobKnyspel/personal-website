Statistical power refers to the probability of a statistical test correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact false. It is influenced by numerous factors, including the sample size and alpha level used in a statistical test and the effect size within the population of interest. Statistical power also influences various outcomes, such as the probability of making a type 1 or type 2 error and the positive and negative predictive values of statistical tests. Importantly, when statistical power is low, this has the following consequences:

- Increased probability of type 2 errors
- Decreased positive predictive value
- Decreased negative predictive value

In this visualisation, you can observe the relationship between statistical power and these outcomes when sample size and effect size remain constant.
