Statistical power refers to the probability of a statistical test correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact false. It is influenced by the sample size used in a statistical test, the alpha level used in a statistical test, and the effect size within the population of interest. Statistical power also influences various outcomes. Importantly, when statistical power is low, this has the following consequences:

- Decreased probability of type 1 errors
- Increased probability of type 2 errors
- Decreased positive predictive value
- Decreased negative predictive value

In the visualisation below, you can observe the relationship between statistical power and these consequences in an example where sample size and effect size remain constant.
