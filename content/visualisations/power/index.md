Statistical power refers to the probability of a statistical test to correctly reject the null hypothesis when it is infact false. It is influenced by numerous factors, including the sample size and significance level (i.e. alpha) used in a statistical test and the effect size within the population of interest. Statistical power also influences various outcomes, such as the probability of making a type 1 or type 2 error and the positive and negative predictive values of statistical tests. In this visualisation, you can observe the relationship between statistical power and these outcomes when sample size and effect size remain constant.
