Gender salience refers to the importance of gender to a person. In psychological research, it has typically been operationalised as the importance of an person's *own gender identity* to them. In other words, a person would be said to exhibit gender salience if their own gender is a prominent and noticeable part of their identity. Although this is an intuitive way of thinking about gender salience, it is problematic. This is because a focus only on gender identity overlooks the possibility that a person might exhibit salience about specific genders with which they do not identify. For example, an agender person (despite, by definition, being “genderless”) might still exhibit gender salience since social norms and personal history are heavily influenced by gender norms. It is also plausible that salience about genders other than one’s own might predict gender-related health outcomes, such as gender dysphoria among transgender individuals. For example, a transgender woman’s experience of gender dysphoria might be related to the strengths of beliefs, or importance of beliefs, she has retained about her previous gender.

According to this new conception of gender salience then, a person would be said to be gender salient if they have strong internal beliefs about gender which are personally important to them, regardless of whether these beliefs refer specifically to their own gender identity. This conception of gender salience forms the basis of the Gender Salience Scale (GSS).
