The overall aim of this research project is to develop and validate a new quantitative scale of *gender salience*, defined simply as the importance of gender to an individual in everyday life. As a background to this, previous research has long relied on problematic conceptions of gender salience, as well as problematic methods for measuring gender salience. Most notably, gender salience has only typically been conceptualised as the importance of an individual’s *own gender identity* to them, something which neglects other aspects of gender salience which might be equally important. 

A focus only on gender identity overlooks the possibility that a person might be salient about specific genders with which they do not identify, something which is especially relevant if we consider individuals who identify as transgender, nonbinary, gender fluid, or agender. It is plausible for example that a person who identifies as *agender* might nonetheless be gender salient insofar as gender itself continues to influence societal norms and insofar as they have a history identifying with or being identified with a particular gender. It is also plausible that salience about genders other than one’s own gender identity might predict gender-related health outcomes, such as gender dysphoria among transgender individuals.

According to this new conception of gender salience then, a person would be said to be gender salient if they have strong internal beliefs about gender which are personally important to them, regardless of whether these beliefs refer specifically to their own gender identity. This conception of gender salience forms the basis of the Gender Salience Scale (GSS).
